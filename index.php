      <h2>Welcome to Biology Trainer!</h2>
   </div>

   <div class="index-content">
      <p>Biology is an intimidating subject for many students due to the massive amount of vocabulary words. Students are expected to learn over one hundred terms throughout a single semester. Those who have a difficult time learning the vocabulary are doomed to repeat the course or change their major. However...</p>
      
      <p>Biology Trainer is a free tool that you can use to master the language of biology. This website offers vocabulary lists based on subject, flashcards for all of the terms, and quizzes to give a clear indication on how well you will be able to recall the terms on your next test.</p>
      
      <p>No signup is required and the website will always be free. Eventually, website users will be given the option to register so they can make their own flashcards and quizzes, which will help a ton with midterm and final study guides. Have fun! P.S. If the site ends up helping you a lot, please consider donating one dollar by clicking the yellow button in the top right of this page. I will use that money to build a lot of websites similar to this one.</p>
